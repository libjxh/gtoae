Easy Drop-Down is a simple jQuery plugin for creating drop-down panels. I always seem to need this and can never find it when I do. The drop-down panel is a div that can contain anything, and an optional callback function captures click-events on the panel and its children. 

That's pretty much it- the rest is up to you.
